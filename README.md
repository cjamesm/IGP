# Islamic Geometric Patterns

I'd like to build a project for the generation of Islamic Geometric Patterns. I'm a big fan of the book by Eric Broug, but I also love the mathematics behind the patterns, so I want to see if I can exploit them in programming somehow.

# Girih tiles

One way I can develop this project is to use Girih tiles, which are used in one method of producing IGP designs. My immediate question is that I need to find out how the Girih tiles may fit together along their edges, and so I need to find out the angles which Girih tiles have. Luckily after a quick Google I got that info straight from Wikipedia. 


From Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girih_tiles:
Five tiles
The five shapes of the tiles are:

a regular decagon with ten interior angles of 144°;
an elongated (irregular convex) hexagon with interior angles of 72°, 144°, 144°, 72°, 144°, 144°;
a bow tie (non-convex hexagon) with interior angles of 72°, 72°, 216°, 72°, 72°, 216°;
a rhombus with interior angles of 72°, 108°, 72°, 108°; and
a regular pentagon with five interior angles of 108°.
All sides of these figures have the same length; and all their angles are multiples of 36° (π/5 radians). All of them, except the pentagon, have bilateral (reflection) symmetry through two perpendicular lines. Some have additional symmetries. Specifically, the decagon has tenfold rotational symmetry (rotation by 36°); and the pentagon has fivefold rotational symmetry (rotation by 72°).

Girih
Girih are lines (strapwork) which decorate the tiles. The tiles are used to form girih patterns, from the Persian word گره, meaning "knot". In most cases, only the girih (and other minor decorations like flowers) are visible rather than the boundaries of the tiles themselves. The girih are piece-wise straight lines which cross the boundaries of the tiles at the center of an edge at 54° (3π/10) to the edge. Two intersecting girih cross each edge of a tile. Most tiles have a unique pattern of girih inside the tile which are continuous and follow the symmetry of the tile. However, the decagon has two possible girih patterns one of which has only fivefold rather than tenfold rotational symmetry.
